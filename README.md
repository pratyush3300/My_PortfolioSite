#About this Project 

I recently developed a new version of my portfolio website using Tailwind CSS, aimed at creating a more modern, responsive, and visually consistent user experience. Unlike my previous version, this site leverages Tailwind's utility-first approach to build custom layouts more efficiently without writing lengthy custom CSS. Overall, the new portfolio not only looks more professional but also reflects better front-end development practices, making it easier to maintain and scale in the future.
